This static site generator generates most, but not all features of markdown. This is an overview. It has one notable extension: It supports including math written in LaTeX.


# Math

Inline math can be included. This:

```
Inline math can be included: \$\sum_{k = 1}^n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\$.
```

Will render as:

Inline math can be included: $\sum_{k = 1}^n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.

It is also possible to use math in 'display mode'. This:

```
It is also possible to use math in 'display mode':
\$\$ \sum_{k = 1}^n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \$\$
```

Will render as:

It is also possible to use math in 'display mode':
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $$


# Headings

Headings can be generated by prefixing a line with `#`. For example, this code:
```
# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
```

Generates:

# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading


## Horizontal Rules

There are multiple ways to denote horizontal lines:

```
___

---

***
```


## Emphasis

There are multiple ways to denote emphasis:
```
**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~
```

This code generates:

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

It is also possible to combine emphasis:
```
text *that is both bold and italic*!
text *that is both bold and italic*!
text _that is both bold and italic_!
text _that is both bold and italic_!
text **that is both bold and *italic***!
text **that is both bold and _italic_**!
text __that is both bold and *italic*__!
text __that is both bold and _italic___!
```

Will result in:
text *that is both bold and italic*!
text *that is both bold and italic*!
text _that is both bold and italic_!
text _that is both bold and italic_!
text **that is both bold and *italic***!
text **that is both bold and _italic_**!
text __that is both bold and *italic*__!
text __that is both bold and _italic___!

Combining aterisks for both bold and italic text might confuse your editor's syntax highlighting, though ;)


## Blockquotes

A quote can be inserted by prefixing the text to be quoted by a '>':
```
> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.
```

This looks like:
> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

#### Unordered

```
+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Start numbering with offset:
```

```

57. foo
